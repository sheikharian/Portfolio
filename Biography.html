                <div id="text">
                    <p>Born near the end of the year 2002, during the month of November, 
                    I have lived in Astoria for my entire life with both of my parents, 
                    and an older brother. 
                    Currently I'm in my Junior year at Queens Technical High School, 
                    where I am learning the principles and elements of design in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign.
                    Outside of school, once a week, I visit the Salesforce tower near Times Square, where I am learning about computer programming.</p>
                    <p>In my freetime, I'm usually either watching videos, playing games, or illustrating.
                    Illustration has been one of my hobbies for years, 
                    and I have recently decided to show my creations and drawings on social media, specifically my Instagram.
                    Playing games and watching videos online have been my time-waster ever since I attended elementary school.
                    For my works produced while learning at Salesforce, some are presented on the "Projects" page.</p>
                    <p>I have always followed others in life, with the idea of getting a high-paying job to satisfy my parents. 
                    Such an idea was clouding my mind until I decided to push my boundaries by entering programs that seemed interesting,
                    such as the Graphic Design program and the coding course my school offered, now called Code Nation.
                    From there, my mind has expanded to consider the multiple career paths that I can now follow,
                    careers that are focused more on what I have a passion for rather than what other want me to do.</p>
